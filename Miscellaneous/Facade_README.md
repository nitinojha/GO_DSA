### Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by hiding the complexity and exposing only the essential parts.

#### Key Features:
- **Simplification**: Offers a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Unified Interface**: Combines several interfaces into one.
- **Hides Complexity**: Conceals the details of implementation from clients.

#### Benefits:
- **Ease of Use**: Makes the usage of complex systems easier by providing a simple interface.
- **Reduces Dependencies**: Minimizes dependencies on internal subsystem components, making the system more manageable and reducing the potential for code changes when internal details change.
- **Improves Code Readability**: Enhanced readability by hiding the complexity of the subsystem.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Limited Flexibility**: Can potentially limit the functionality exposed to clients, oversimplifying to the point where not all use cases are supported.
- **Performance Overhead**: Introducing an additional layer can sometimes add overhead, although it is usually minimal.

The Facade pattern is useful for creating a high-level interface to a set of systems or components, making a library, framework, or complex codebase easier to interact with. Commonly, this is used in systems that are evolving, as it shields clients from changes in the underlying subsystem.
